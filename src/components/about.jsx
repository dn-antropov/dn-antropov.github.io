          I'm a creative developer and a technical artist. I find inspiration in
          the constantly evolving world of technology, always exploring new ways to communicate
          ideas and narratives — both my own and those of the people I work with or work for.
          It's no surprise that surviving solely on art projects is no joke, but I still try to do my small artsy bits.
          They help me stay sharp and feed back into the commercial commissions that keep me going.

          Interesting fact about me. I didn't receive professional training in computer science or art.
          After completing my PhD in Art History, I parted ways with art theory in favor of creating my own art.
          Since I couldn't draw or paint, I turned to the only tool available to me at the time — my personal computer.

          I firmly believe that computer science is, in part, a form of literature.
          As a former art historian, I was trained to tell stories, explain theories, and connect them to their
          material basis — the art itself.
          Through that, along with self-education and the support of a community of media artists and creative
          developers, I arrived at whatever it is I do today.
